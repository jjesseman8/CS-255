**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**  
  Driverpass was a project designed to help new students prepare for their DMV written and practical driving tests. This system had to include Online lessons, practice exams, and finally on-the-road trainings. The system was also to be made web based.  
**What did you do particularly well?**  
  I believe the thing I did the best as you can see if you review my Business Requirement Document, is the abillity to take the customers wants and needs and put them on paper for a team to review and create the best software possible for the client.   
**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**  
  I believe that I would upgrade my UML Diagrams to include all the nessasary security features that are not currently in there. Such as two factor autentication.   
**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**   
  As you can see if you review my Client Presentaion template .pptx I took all of the user's needs and implemented them though various as well as thoughrogh ways. When designing a system, it's important to consider the user's needs to ensure that the system is effective, efficient, and user-friendly. This is especially important because users are the ones who will ultimately be using the system, and if their needs are not met, they may not use the system at all or may use it less effectively.
To design a system that meets user needs, it's essential to involve users in the design process, whether through surveys, user testing, or other forms of feedback. This helps designers understand the users' goals, tasks, and pain points, which can then be used to inform the system design. By considering user needs and feedback, designers can create a system that is easy to use, intuitive, and efficient, which can lead to greater user adoption and satisfaction.   
**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**   
  When analyzing and designing a system, there are several techniques and strategies that can be used. One common approach is to use a modeling language or methodology, such as UML (Unified Modeling Language), to help visualize and communicate the system's design. Other techniques that can be used include prototyping, which involves creating a working model of the system to test its functionality and gather feedback, and agile development, which involves an iterative approach to development with frequent feedback and adjustments. Ultimately, the key to successful software design is to remain focused on the problem being solved and to continually gather feedback and adjust the design to meet the needs of stakeholders and users.
